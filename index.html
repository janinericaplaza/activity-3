    <h4> My name is Janine Claire Ricaplaza, and I was born on November 23, 2006, in the vibrant city of Cebu City, Philippines.
     Growing up in a place where history, culture, and technology blend, I've always had a fascination with how things work and how technology shapes our world.
     I come from a small, close-knit family where support and encouragement are always in abundance I am the oldest child in my family, 
     and my parents have always pushed me to chase my dreams, no matter how big they might seems. My dream us to become a professional IT,
      a goal I am working tirelessly toward.

    Cebu has always felt like home. There's something about the rhythm of the waves, the warmth on the people, and the buzz of everyday life that made my childhood feel rich with simple joys.
     I spent my days with family, wandering familiar streets, and savoring the flavors of Filipino food that always felt like comfort on a plate. But even among all that, it was technology that truly sparked something in me. 
     I still remember the first time I touched a computer at the computer shop, how surreal it felt to type, search for things, play little games. It was like opening a door to a whole new world.
      At home, I'd sit beside my older cousins, watching them play video games or surf the internet, completely mesmerized. I wasn't just watching, I was wondering. 
      How did it all work? What made these systems tick? That curiosity quickly turned into questions. Coding, programming, networks, I wanted to understand it all. My parents saw how passionate I was and gave me the space to explore it further.
       In school, I gravitated toward math and science, not just because I was good at them, but because they helped me make sense of the tech I loved. I wasn't just a bookworm, I was a tinkerer. I loved trying out new software,
     figuring out how things worked, and solving problems in creative ways. </h4>

     <h4> While technology is a big part of who I am, I also value balance. When I'm not immersed in coding or learning about new tech, I enjoy reading books, especially those that teach me more about personal development.
         I believe in constantly improving myself, not just as a professional, but as a person. Whether it's learning how to manage my time better or finding new ways to stay motivated, I'm always looking for ways to grow.
         One of the most important values I've learned from my family is perseverance. Growing up, I watched my parents work hard to achieve their goals, and that taught me to never give up, even when things get tough.
          This value has shaped the way I approach everything in life, especially my career goals. I know the path to becoming a professional in IT won't be easy, but I'm ready to face any challenges head-on.</h4>

    <h4>Looking to the future, I am determined to pursue a degree in Information Technology at a reputable university. I plan to specialize in software development and network security, as I'm particularly interested in how the digital world can be made safer and more efficient.
     I want to work with companies that are focused on innovating and developing cutting-edge technology that can change the world. 
     Beyond just career success, I want to use my knowledge to give back to my community. I hope to programs that teach young people how to code and become part of the digital world. The tech industry is growing rapidly, 
     and I want to be a part of that growth, not just as a professional, but as someone who helps guide others into the future. My journey is just beginning, but I'm excited about the path ahead. I know there will be obstacles and challenges, but I believe that with passion, 
     hard work, and a love for technology, I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I am proud of how far I've come, but more than that, I'm excited about where I'm going. I'll continue to pursue my dreams and keep pushing forward, one line of code at a time.</h4>
